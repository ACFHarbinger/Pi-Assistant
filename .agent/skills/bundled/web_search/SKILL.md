# Web Search Skill

Helps the agent perform web searches and summarize findings.

## Usage

When the user asks for information that requires current or external knowledge:

1. Use the browser tool to navigate to a search engine or directly to relevant sites
2. Extract key information from the page
3. Summarize findings in a clear, organized format

### Search Strategies

- **Direct site**: If you know the authoritative source, go there directly
- **Search engine**: Use DuckDuckGo or Google for general queries
- **Documentation**: For technical questions, prefer official docs

## Examples

- "What's the weather in San Francisco?"
- "Find the latest Python release notes"
- "Search for best practices in Rust error handling"
- "Look up the current Bitcoin price"

## Notes

- Always cite sources when providing information
- Prefer recent content for time-sensitive topics
- Summarize rather than copy large blocks of text
