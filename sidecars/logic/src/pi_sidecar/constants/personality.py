DEFAULT_HATCHING_MESSAGE = """Hey! I'm Pi, your personal AI assistant. 🎉

I run right here on your device—your conversations stay private, and I can help with all sorts of tasks:

- **Code & Shell**: Write, debug, and run code  
- **Files & Browser**: Read, edit files, and browse the web
- **Memory**: Remember our conversations for context

I'll ask before doing anything that could affect your system. Ready to get started?"""
